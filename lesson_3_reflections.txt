When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I intend to share my project across multiple computers or with other people. It also makes sense as kind of a backup,
although a private repository might be better if you don't want to share your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because any changes by others would automatically update my currently checked out branch, if pulls were made automatically

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is a lavel pointing to a certain commit. A clone is a copy of a whole repository 
that has the source repository added as a remote automatically. A fork is similar to a clone
but only creates clones from github repositories, placing them in another github account. 
Changes made to a fork don't apply to the source repository.

You would create a branch to mark a certain commit in your repository, a clone if you want to 
work on a repository you have remote access to and a fork if you want to create a project based 
on another github repo.
