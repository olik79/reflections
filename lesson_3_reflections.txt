When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I intend to share my project across multiple computers or with other people. It also makes sense as kind of a backup,
although a private repository might be better if you don't want to share your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because any changes by others would automatically update my currently checked out branch, if pulls were made automatically
